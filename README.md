### a Coding Test i did

> It's a website that fetches pictures from the flicker api, Search functionality with double options [text,Tags] implemented, Infinite scroll implemented.

## What i learnt ?

Using Less any in typescript code, and promoting strong typing in the app.

Improving structure of the App; Separation of Logic/UI.

Should Commit to branch and not main Repository. [Anti pattern otherwise]

Use of IntersectionObserver.

## Stuff to still work on :

Refactoring Css to use css Variables; removing % from margins because it's an anti pattern...etc

Writing tests to prevent side effects from happening if i edit this code in 1 year.
